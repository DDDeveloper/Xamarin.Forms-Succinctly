##Description

The demand for mobile applications across Android, iOS, and Windows platforms often puts developers accustomed to .NET and C# in a bind. The gap between platform operating systems, programming languages, and devices is an immense obstacle. Ideally, these developers would be able use their existing skills and knowledge to build native mobile apps. Xamarin.Forms makes this possible. In Xamarin.Forms Succinctly by Alessandro Del Sole, you will learn how Xamarin.Forms allows developers to build apps for Android, iOS, and Windows from a single C# codebase through the use of containers, controls, navigation, data binding, native APIs, and more.
